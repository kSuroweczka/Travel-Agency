# Travel-Agency
## What is it intended for?
Travel-Agency is a web application intended for travel agencies.

On the website you can find tour offers, add/remove from the cart. One of the conveniences is also adding your own tour with the required fields. You can also change your currency from anywhere on the website. By clicking on a specific trip, the details of the trip will be displayed, where you can leave a rating and review. 

The application has two integrated versions of the backend implementation, which are dynamically selected by the user. For this purpose, the application was integrated with FireBase and its own REST API server was built.

## Technology

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
